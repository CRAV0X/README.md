# README.md
I build fast, secure web products. Full-stack across Next.js, Laravel, and WordPress. I care about performance, SEO, and reliability. I use Docker, CI/CD, and least-privilege access. Recent work: storefronts, landing pages, dashboards. Goal: ship clean UX with strong security that scales without drama.
